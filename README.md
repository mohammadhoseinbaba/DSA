About

The DSA repository is a collection of essential data structures and algorithms, implemented and explained in JavaScript. From array traversals to complex sorting algorithms, this repository is designed to support learners in mastering DSA concepts for coding interviews, competitive programming, or academic purposes.
Features

    Modular JavaScript Code: Each algorithm and data structure is implemented in JavaScript, with a focus on readability and modularity.
    Conceptual Documentation: Clear explanations accompany each code file, helping you understand the purpose, time complexity, and space complexity.
    Examples & Test Cases: Each function is provided with example input and output cases to aid understanding.
    Beginner-Friendly: Well-structured code and documentation to help even absolute beginners get started with DSA.

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/DSA.git
cd DSA

Explore the code: Open any of the files to see the algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript.

Run the code: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

    node path/to/yourFile.js

    Learn & Experiment: Tweak the code, add your test cases, and try new variations!

Each folder is dedicated to a specific data structure or category of algorithms. Inside each file, you will find the code for the DSA concept, along with detailed comments explaining the logic, usage, and complexity.
Concepts Covered

    Array Traversals and Searching: Basic traversals, binary search, linear search
    Linked Lists: Singly and doubly linked lists, insertion, deletion, traversal
    Stacks and Queues: Implementation, usage, and practical applications
    Trees and Graphs: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals, and basic graph algorithms
    Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort, selection sort, quicksort, mergesort, and more
    Recursion: Basics of recursion, recursive algorithms, and common problems

    Note: Each file includes explanations for both the approach and the complexity analysis.
